This practice application has been created to practice advanced React concepts such as: React Hooks, custom React Hooks, React Router, Redux, Redux Toolkit, Global State using Url, modern React file structure (slices) and more.. It is compiled using Vite.

This application started with planning/structuring the whole project from the scratch. The following steps were taken to get things started:

- 1. Gather application requirements and features
- 2. Divide the application into pages
- 3. Divide the application into feature categories/slices
- 4. Decide what technologies to use

You can view more details on structuring this application in PLAN.md file.

This application allows users to see a pizza menu, add/delete pizza items in their cart, update cart, delete cart, place order, search order, update order and finally make their orders priority. It also grabs user's address and prefills the form using reverse-geolocation technology. Note: canceling order feature isn't available in this version.

Please check out installation section on this README before running the application.
